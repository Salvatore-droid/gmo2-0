        Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. 
        This technology allows for the introduction of new traits or enhancement of existing characteristics in plants, animals, and microorganisms.
        In agriculture, GMOs are primarily used to improve crop yields, enhance nutritional content, increase drought tolerance, 
        and provide resistance to pests and diseases.

    "regulations": """
        In the United States, three federal agencies regulate GMOs:
        1. FDA - Ensures food safety
        2. USDA - Oversees plant health and environmental safety
        3. EPA - Regulates pesticide use in GMO plants
        The approval process typically takes 5-7 years and involves extensive testing for:
        - Food safety
        - Environmental impact
        - Efficacy claims

    "crops": """
        Common GMO crops and their adoption rates in the US (2023):
        - Corn: 92% of acreage
        - Soybeans: 94% of acreage
        - Cotton: 96% of acreage
        - Canola: 95% of acreage
        These crops are primarily modified for:
        - Insect resistance (Bt traits)
        - Herbicide tolerance
        - Drought resistance

    "verification": """
        To verify GMO seeds or products:
        1. Check for certification tags or labels
        2. Look for a unique identifier code (usually a QR code)
        3. Verify through the manufacturer's database
        4. Consult the USDA's Bioengineered Food Disclosure list
        5. Use approved testing kits for field verification
    """,
    "safety": """
        Scientific consensus on GMO safety:
        - Over 2,800 independent studies have found GMOs to be as safe as conventional crops
        - Major health organizations (WHO, AMA, AAAS) endorse their safety
        - Longest study: 10-year multi-generational study showing no adverse effects
        Potential benefits:
        - Reduced pesticide use (37% decrease)
        - Increased yields (22% average increase)
        - Enhanced nutrition (Golden Rice with Vitamin A)
